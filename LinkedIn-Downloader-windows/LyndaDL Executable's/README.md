# LyndaDL

LindaDL is based on https://github.com/r0oth3x49/lynda-dl but I have added an option to download list of courses specified in a text file using cookies and created executables to make your life easier. It separate the chapters and download subtitles.

The whole Lynda/LinkedIn Learning courses database is added in the text file
I have provided a working cookie in the package, but it may expire at some point so you will have to add your own then.

If you want to use this program to download LinkedIn learning courses the main task is to find the original course link in Lynda.com 

<b>If in your case, the course name is Learning Mailchimp </b>

<b>Open Lynda.com and search for your course, the search suggestions are really helpful </b>

<b>This is what you are interested in... the original course link in the browser search field</b>

<b>Paste that link in coursesList.txt file. You can paste multiple links line by line </b>

<b>Run LyndaDL.exe</b>

That's all you need to do.
